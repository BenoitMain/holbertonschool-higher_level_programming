# 📘 Object-Oriented Programming in Python

## 📚 Background Context

⚠️ **It’s VERY important** to read all the material listed below *(and skip what we recommend you to skip—you’ll see those topics later in the curriculum).*

🧠 As usual, make sure you **type** (never copy-paste), **test**, and **understand** every example shown in the resources (including videos). Then **test again**.

> 🚀 The most important takeaway of this project:
> **Experiment OOP yourself, play with it!**

## 🧾 Resources to Read or Watch (in order)

- [🏗️ **Object Oriented Programming**](https://python.swaroopch.com/oop.html)
  *(Read everything up to the “Inheritance” section — skip it for now)*

- 🧠 [**Object-Oriented Programming (realpython)**](https://python-course.eu/oop/object-oriented-programming.php)

  📌 Read the following sections only:
  - General Introduction
  - First-class Everything
  - A Minimal Class in Python
  - Attributes *(ignore class attributes)*
  - Methods
  - The `__init__` Method
  - Data Abstraction, Encapsulation, and Information Hiding
  - Public, Protected, and Private Attributes

- [⚖️ **Properties vs. Getters and Setters**](https://python-course.eu/oop/properties-vs-getters-and-setters.php)
- [🎥 **Learn to Program 9: Object Oriented Programming (YouTube)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AGyBuVCTeE&ab_channel=DerekBanas)

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts **without using Google**:

### 💡 General Concepts

- ❓ What is OOP
- 🧠 What does “first-class everything” mean
- 🧬 What is a class
- 🧱 What is an object and an instance
- 🔄 Difference between class and object/instance
- 🎒 What is an attribute
- 🔐 Public, protected, and private attributes
- 🙋 What is `self`
- ⚙️ What is a method
- 🚪 What is the `__init__` method and how to use it
- 🧊 What is Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding
- 🏷️ What is a property
- 📍 Difference between attribute and property in Python
- 🐍 How to write Pythonic getters and setters
- 🧩 How to dynamically create new attributes for existing instances
- 🧷 How to bind attributes to objects and classes
- 📖 What is the `__dict__` of a class or instance and what it contains
- 🧭 How Python finds object/class attributes
- 🔎 How to use the `getattr()` function

## ⚙️ Project Requirements

- 🔧 Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- 🐍 All files will be interpreted/compiled on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** using `python3` (version 3.8.5)
- ↩️ All files should end with a new line
- 📄 The first line of all your files should be exactly: `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- 📄 A ```README.md ``` file at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
- 🎯 Your code should follow pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)
- ✅ All your files must be executable
- 📏 The length of your files will be tested using ``` wc ```

## 📚 Documentation Requirements

**Every file must include proper docstrings:**

- ▶️ All tests should be executed by: `python3 -m doctest ./tests/*`
- 📖 All modules should have documentation: `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`
- 📖 All functions should have documentation: `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'`
- 🗒️ Documentation must be a real sentence explaining the purpose of the module, class, or method (length is verified)
- 🤝 We strongly encourage collaboration on test cases to catch every edge case – The Checker is checking for tests!
- 📌 A docstring must be a full sentence, not just a word. Its length and clarity will be verified.

## ℹ️ More Info

**📝 Documentation is now mandatory!**

Each module, class, and method must contain docstrings as comments.
