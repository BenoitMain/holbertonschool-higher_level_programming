# 🌐 Server-Side Rendering with Flask and Python

**Server-side rendering (SSR)** 🖥️ is a powerful technique where web pages are generated on the server and sent to the client as fully formed HTML. This contrasts with **client-side rendering (CSR)** 🧠, where the browser builds the web page using JavaScript and dynamic data.

🔧 Through this project, you will learn how to implement SSR using **Python** 🐍 and **Flask**, leveraging the **Jinja templating engine** 🧩 to create dynamic, efficient, and SEO-friendly 🔍 web applications.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- ✅ Understand the concepts of SSR and how it differs from CSR
- 🚀 Learn the benefits of SSR in web development
- 🧑‍💻 Implement SSR in Python using the Flask framework
- 🧩 Use the Jinja templating engine to dynamically generate HTML pages
- 📊 Read and display data from various sources: JSON, CSV, and SQLite databases
- ✍️ Handle dynamic content and user input in web applications

---

## 🔍 What to Expect

In this project, you will build a **Flask application** that serves web pages using **server-side rendering** techniques.
You'll start by creating **basic templates** 🏗️ and gradually move on to integrating **dynamic content** from multiple data sources 📂.

✅ By the end of the project, you'll have a solid understanding of:
- SSR 🖥️
- Jinja templating 🧩
- How to build efficient, scalable web applications ⚙️
