# 📡 RESTful API Project - Holberton School

## 🧭 Introduction

In today’s interconnected software landscape, **RESTful APIs** are fundamental for communication between services. This project explores the development and consumption of REST APIs using tools like `curl`, Python, and frameworks such as `Flask`.

We’ll dive into HTTP/HTTPS protocols, build and consume APIs, handle data securely, and document them properly — equipping you with crucial backend development skills.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- **HTTP/HTTPS Basics:** Understand how data is transferred securely over the web.
- **API Consumption with curl:** Learn to make API calls using command-line tools.
- **API Consumption with Python:** Use Python to interact with and process API data.
- **API Development with `http.server`:** Create simple APIs using native Python.
- **API Development with Flask:** Build scalable APIs using Flask.
- **API Security & Authentication:** Secure your APIs with Basic Auth & JWT.
- **API Standards & OpenAPI:** Understand the importance of documentation.

## 🧠 Why This Matters

APIs are the glue of the modern digital world — from mobile apps to industrial systems. Learning to develop and consume secure, well-documented APIs prepares you for real-world integration challenges.

## 🗺️ REST API Conceptual Diagram

```text
+--------+          +-----------+          +-----------+         +-----------+
| Client | -------> | Web Server| -------> | API Server| ------> | Database  |
|        | <------- |           | <------- |           | <------ |           |
+--------+          +-----------+          +-----------+         +-----------+

```

- **Client:** Initiates the request (e.g., browser, mobile app)
- **Web Server:** Routes requests to the API server
- **API Server:** Processes logic and interacts with data
- **Database:** Stores and retrieves the requested data

## 🔁 Flow: RESTful API Communication

1. 🧑‍💻 **Client** sends an **HTTP/HTTPS** request to the **Web Server**.
2. 🌐 **Web Server**, after potential routing and load balancing ⚖️, forwards the request to the **API Server**.
3. 🧠 **API Server** processes the request 🛠️, and interacts with the **Database** 🗄️ if needed.
4. 📤 **API Server** returns the processed response to the **Web Server**.
5. 📩 **Web Server** sends back the final **HTTP/HTTPS** response to the **Client**.

🔍 This diagram provides a **high-level view** of how RESTful API communication typically works.
🛠️ In simpler setups, the **Web Server** and **API Server** might be combined into one.
🏗️ The separation here illustrates potential layers in a more **complex or scaled environment**.
