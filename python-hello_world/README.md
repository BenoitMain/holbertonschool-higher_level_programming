# 🎉 Holberton Python Project 🐍

## Author’s Disclaimer 🤔

Welcome to the Python world! 🌎

You’ll soon find that with Python (and most higher-level languages), there are ten different ways to do the same thing. Some tasks will expect only one implementation, while others will have multiple valid approaches.

Python has a linter / style guide, called PEP8, also now known as PyCode. At Holberton, we won’t start off with PyCode (it’s stricter than PEP8). Don’t worry if you see a warning when running PEP8—you can safely ignore it. ✔️

Enjoy! ✨

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain to anyone—without Google:

### ✨ General

- 🖥️ How to use the Python interpreter
- 🖨️ How to print text and variables using `print`
- 🔤 How to work with strings
- 🔢 What indexing and slicing are in Python
- 📏 What the official Python coding style is and how to check your code with `pycodestyle`

---

## ✅ Requirements

### 🐍 Python Scripts

- **Allowed editors:** `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- **Environment:** Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, Python 3.8.*
- **Shebang:** First line of all files must be `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- **Newline:** All files must end with a single new line
- **Executable:** All files must be marked executable (chmod +x) 🚀

### 🎨 Style

- Follow **PEP8** and check with `pycodestyle` (version 2.7.*).
- PyCode warnings can be ignored at this stage.

### 📄 Documentation

- A `README.md` at the root of the repo with a project description is **mandatory**.

### 📏 File Size

- File lengths will be tested with `wc`.

## 🔎 More Info

**Pycodestyle**
Pycodestyle is now the standard for Python style code. Install and run to verify compliance:

```bash
pip install pycodestyle==2.7.*
pycodestyle *.py
