# 🎯 Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google :

## 🧩 General

- 🏆 **What is a superclass, baseclass or parentclass**
- 🧸 **What is a subclass**
- 📋 **How to list all attributes and methods of a class or instance**
- 💡 **When can an instance have new attributes**
- 🪜 **How to inherit a class from another**
- 🔀 **How to define a class with multiple base classes**
- 📦 **What is the default class every class inherit from**
- 🔄 **How to override a method or attribute inherited from the base class**
- 📥 **Which attributes or methods are available by heritage to subclasses**
- 🎯 **What is the purpose of inheritance**
- 🔍 **What are, when and how to use `isinstance`, `issubclass`, `type` and `super` built-in functions**

## ⚙️ Project Requirements

- 🔧 Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- 🐍 All files will be interpreted/compiled on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** using `python3` (version 3.8.5)
- ↩️ All files should end with a new line
- 📄 The first line of all your files should be exactly: `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- 📄 A ```README.md ``` file at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
- 🎯 Your code should follow pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)
- ✅ All your files must be executable
- 📏 The length of your files will be tested using ``` wc ```

## 📚 Documentation Requirements

**Every file must include proper docstrings:**

- ▶️ All tests should be executed by: `python3 -m doctest ./tests/*`
- 📖 All modules should have documentation: `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`
- 📖 All functions should have documentation: `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'`
- 🗒️ Documentation must be a real sentence explaining the purpose of the module, class, or method (length is verified)
- 🤝 We strongly encourage collaboration on test cases to catch every edge case – The Checker is checking for tests!
- 📌 A docstring must be a full sentence, not just a word. Its length and clarity will be verified.
